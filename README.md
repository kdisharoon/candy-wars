# candy-wars
Travel through different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, buying and selling candy and fluctuating prices. Try to make as much money as possible!

Program initially written as a high school capstone project on the command line in Turbo Pascal. I don't have the code for that, but as I reenter the tech world, I want to rewrite this using modern design principles and technologies. Of course, including fun Pittsburgh references is key.

The initial focus is on Java OOP, utilizing different classes for candies, neighborhoods and controlling gameplay via CandyApp. Initially this should be a 30-day game where you can travel to a different neighborhood each day and be presented with a menu listing prices for each candy (randomly generated subject to certain constraints) and can choose to buy or sell.

You may also encounter situations where you will gain or lose a certain amount of candy based on neighborhood factors.

The eventual goal is to read in candy and neighborhood info from a database using custom API calls, rather than hard-coding that info. Web interface rather than command-line as well.
